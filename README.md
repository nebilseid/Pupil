# Android Technical Test


The basic framework of the application was already given already exists,
but needed to be extended with the some or all of the given requirements.

although the main requirements are achieved there's a few missing.
for example, the room persistence for when there's no internet connection hasn't been implemented.
another important feature not included in the requirement but mandatory was unit testing and it's not included.

I don't wanna give any excuse for not doing something but I would like to say that I had a family emergency and I didn't
focus on this as much as I would have had in a normal circumstances.

Other than that I have tried to maintain a production quality code.
- used material design and tried to create simple but elegant ui. I used some animation for the list.
- created navigation class
- handled errors
- created custom header
- used progress bar for the loading state
- I put validation check on the editTexts to meet the api's requirement (for demonstration purpose, it was only implemented on image url)

 The lorempixel server for image is too slow or sometimes it's down so the image on pupil's details screen doesn't show. tried it picasso
 and glide but it's the same. took the url's and checked sometimes it takes few minutes to load and sometimes it doesn't even load.

 In general I believe I can do better but what I achieved is not a bad thing considering my personal situation.

 Thanks
